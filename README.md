# MovieReviewer
Reddit movie reviewer @ http://uiuccssait.web.illinois.edu

Our tool is focusing on collecting reviews of a given movie name from reddit, process the text and analyze the userâ€™s sentiment towards the movie. We will finally give a score of the movie as evaluation from the sentiment analysis and show the comments with the strongest sentiment. 

Note: Not quite work in Safari on iPhone or iPad. Optimized for Chrome.

## Details
We use a binary classifier to decide each review to be good or bad. Then we calculate the total score for a movie by count of good reviews/total count of reviews.
